# CAVEAT!

This may be wrong. This is a work in progress. Language design is more
aesthetic than it is empirical. I reserve the right to change my mind.

While I believe in Larry Wall's observation of "[Tormenting the implementor on
behalf of the
user](https://archive.fosdem.org/2015/interviews/2015-larry-wall/)", the
specific details of implementation should and do depend on multiple details,
including the details of who will actually do the work. Thus they are subject
to change in ways that the rest of these reflections will not.

# DESCRIPTION

How should an object system be implemented?

# TBD
