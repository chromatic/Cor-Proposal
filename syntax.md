# CAVEAT!

This may be wrong. This is a work in progress. Language design is more
aesthetic than it is empirical. I reserve the right to change my mind.

This reflects my preferences for an object system, which may not be yours and
are certainly not everyone's. This document relies more on personal taste and
the underlying principles of other parts of these reflections, so the amount to
which you disagree with other parts of this proposal may dictate how much you
find these thoughts objectionable.

# DESCRIPTION

How should users interact with an object system?

# TBD
